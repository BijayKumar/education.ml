If you make any changes here, you need to copy them to /var/www/html to be picked up by apache.

If you need any new proxy configs, you need to make changes to $PIPELINE_HOME/config/advancedspark.com/advancedspark.conf

You'll also want to test the new Apache config as follows:
```
apache2ctl configtest
```

And then restart Apache as follows:
```
apache2ctl restart
```
